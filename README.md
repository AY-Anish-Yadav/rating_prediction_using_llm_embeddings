# Review Prediction Using LLM Embedding Model

![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)

## Overview

Using embeddings from large language models, we can effectively predict ratings from text reviews by converting reviews into dense vector representations and then training a regression model on these embeddings.

## Features

- Input text through a web interface
- Display the predicted rating on the web page.
